# Eye Disease Detection Using CNN

## Project Overview
This project aims to **identify and classify eye diseases** from provided eye images, focusing on conditions such as **diabetic retinopathy, cataract, and glaucoma**. 
By leveraging deep learning techniques, the project utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect these diseases with high accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Deep Learning Framework**: Built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** libraries.
- **Image Processing**: Eye images are preprocessed, including resizing, rescaling, and data augmentation, to improve model performance.
- **CNN Model**: A robust CNN architecture has been trained to classify eye diseases.
- **Confidence Scores**: For each prediction, the model provides a confidence score, indicating the certainty of its classification.

## Model Highlights
- **Dataset**: The model is trained and validated using a dataset containing labeled images of different eye conditions.
- **Training Strategy**: The data is split into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) sets to ensure effective model learning and evaluation.
- **Real-time Prediction**: The trained model can be used to make predictions on new, unseen images, outputting both the predicted disease and the confidence level of that prediction.

## Applications
This project has significant implications for early detection of eye diseases, aiding in timely diagnosis and treatment, especially in areas where medical resources are limited.
